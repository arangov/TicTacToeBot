# TicTacToeBot
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe Bot that runs via the CLI that will never lose against any user it plays.

The bot is played via the CLI and allows you to choose which you side you would like to play on.

The way the game works is that the top row of the table goes from 0 to 2, the middle row goes from 3-5, and
the bottom row goes from 6-8. The game will not allow you to choose a number that has already been chosen or a number outside
of the range 0-8.

Overall, have fun and try to beat the bot (unless you cheat, you won't).
